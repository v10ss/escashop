- ✅ Container orchestration dependencies
- ✅ Docker build processes and scripts

#### What Was Retained:
- ✅ Test-specific Docker configuration (`docker-compose.test.yml`)
- ✅ Monitoring stack Docker setup (`docker-compose.monitoring.yml`)
- ✅ Database test containers for CI/CD

#### Impact:
- **Positive**: Simplified deployment, faster startup, reduced complexity
- **Neutral**: No impact on core functionality

  promtail:
    image: grafana/promtail:latest
    
  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana:latest
    ports: ["3002:3000"]
```

#### Key Metrics Tracked:
- Application performance and response times
- Database query performance and connection health
- Queue management operations and customer flow
- Midnight reset process monitoring
- Error rates and system alerts

### 4. Database Migration Strategy
